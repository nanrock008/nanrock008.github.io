 abstract = {A vortex magnetic anisotropy (VMA) was formed via the competition of residual stresses between radial and tangential directions in the FeCoAlO soft magnetic films (SMFs), prepared by a composition gradient sputtering (CGS) method. The VMA of the magnetic films gives rise to a rotating excitation direction of the ferromagnetic resonance. As a results, the as-deposited FeCoAlO films exhibit good high-frequency ferromagnetic properties with high permeability about 100, cut-off frequency over 2 GHz, and Qm factor over 50 along its individual excitation direction. These SMFs with the VMA are promising in the integration with the circular spiral inductors due to the geometrical match between the excitation direction of the SMFs and the circular inductor lines.
