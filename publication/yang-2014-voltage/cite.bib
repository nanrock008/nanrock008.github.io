 abstract = {Compact voltage tunable phase shifters on yttrium iron garnet/lead magnesium niobate lead titanate heterostructure are presented. A comparison of E-field tunability between 1-layer PMN-PT structure and two-layer PMN-PT structure using bending mode is discussed. The device exhibited a phase shift of 119° under an electric field of 11 kV/cm. The device combining with multiferroics and partially magnetized ferrite concepts is able to operate with the absence of external bias magnetic field. It is more compact and power efficient than traditional multiferroic devices. © 2014 IEEE.},
