 abstract = {Researchers report on the fabrication and characterization of self-biased anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) magnetic field sensors with a sensitivity limit of approximately 150 nT at 3 Hz on PR buffered flexible polyethylene terephthalate (PET) foils, and a sensitivity of 42 T-1 which is close to that of the AMR on rigid oxidized Si substrate. At the same time these AMR sensors on flexible substrates show excellent deformation stability. No degradation of electrical output has been observed with bending radii down to 5 mm.},
