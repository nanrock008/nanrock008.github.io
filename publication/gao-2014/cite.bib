 abstract = {We report new high quality factor (Q) integrated GHz magnetic inductors based on solenoid structures with FeGaB/ \$\backslash$rm Al\-\2\\$\backslash$rm O\-\3\ multilayer films, which show significantly enhanced inductance and quality factor at GHz frequencies over their air core counterparts. These inductors show an excellent high-frequency performance with a wide operation frequency range 0.5-2.5 GHz, in which the inductance is flat and the peak quality factor can reach \$\backslash$sim\\$\backslash$rm 20\. The inductance of the magnetic inductor shows \\textgreater\\100$\backslash$%\ enhancement compared with that of the same size air core inductor. These novel GHz inductors with high inductance and Q enhancement show great promise for applications in radio frequency integrated circuits. Â© 1963-2012 IEEE.},
