abstract = {Engineered heterostructures formed by complex oxide materials are a rich source of emergent phenomena and technological applications. In the quest for new functionality, a vastly unexplored avenue is interfacing oxide perovskites with materials having dissimilar crystallochemical properties. Here, we propose a unique class of heterointerfaces based on nitride antiperovskite and oxide perovskite materials as a previously unidentified direction for materials design. We demonstrate the fabrication of atomically sharp interfaces between nitride antiperovskite Mn3GaN and oxide perovskites (La0.3Sr0.7)(Al0.65Ta0.35)O3 and SrTiO3. Using atomic-resolution imaging/ spectroscopic techniques and first-principles calculations, we determine the atomic-scale structure, composition, and bonding at the interface. The epitaxial antiperovskite/perovskite heterointerface is mediated by a coherent interfacial monolayer that interpolates between the two antistructures. We anticipate our results to be an important step for the development of functional antiperovskite/perovskite heterostructures, combining their unique characteristics such as topological properties for ultralow-power applications.},
