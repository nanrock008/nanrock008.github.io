 abstract = {Resonant direct and converse magnetoelectric (ME) effects have been investigated experimentally and theoretically in FeGa/PZT/FeGa sandwich laminate composites under the same electric and magnetic bias conditions. Resonant direct ME effect (DME) occurs at antiresonance frequency while resonant converse ME effect (CME) occurs at resonance frequency. The antiresonance and resonance frequencies have close but different values under identical bias conditions. The magnitudes of resonant effective ME coefficients for direct and converse ME effects are also not equal. A model was developed to describe the frequency response of DME and CME in laminate composite, which was in good agreement with experimental results. Â© 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.},
