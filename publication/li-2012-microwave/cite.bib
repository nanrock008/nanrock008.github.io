 abstract = {The fabrication and high-frequency ferromagnetic performances of nanocrystalline Fe70Co30-B soft magnetic films were investigated. It is revealed that the composition gradient sputtering method dramatically improves the high-frequency soft magnetic properties of the as-prepared films. This method gives rise to almost a linearly-increased distribution of compositions and residual stress. As a result, a very high ferromagnetic resonance frequency up to 6.7 GHz, high uniaxial magnetic anisotropic field up to 450 Oe, and low magnetic loss were obtained in as-deposited samples, which are particularly in favor of the integration between magnetic films and microwave components.
