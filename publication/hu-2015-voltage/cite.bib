 abstract = {Multiferroic composites with combined ferromagnetic (FM) and ferroelectric (FE) phases have attracted extensive attention due to their strong magnetoelectric (ME) coupling at room temperature [1-4]. Specifically in magnetic-piezoelectric heterostructures, the voltage applied to the piezoelectric layer produces a mechanical deformation that couples to the magnetic layer, and thus induces a change in the magnetic anisotropy and a shift in the resonance field for the ferromagnet. Large voltage-induced effective ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) field has been demonstrated in multifer-roic composites such as YIG/PZT, FeGaB/PZNPT, Ni2MnGa/PMNPT, etc [5-7]. Unlike conventional devices where the Oersted fields generated by large electric current are used for FMR tuning, the voltage tuning is more power efficient as the bias voltage applied on piezoelectrics involves minimal electric current. Therefore, these magnetic-piezoelectric heterostructures show great potential for the next-generation of compact, lightweight, and energy-efficient RF/microwave devices.},
