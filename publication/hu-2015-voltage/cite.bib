 abstract = {We report strong voltage tuning of magnetism in FeGaB deposited on [011]-poled Pb(In1/2Nb1/2)O3-Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-PbTiO3 (PIN-PMN-PT) ternary single crystals to achieve more than 2 times broader operational range and increased thermal stability as compared to heterostructures based on binary relaxors. Voltage-induced effective ferromagnetic resonance field shift of 180 Oe for electric field from -6.7 kV/cm to 11 kV/cm was observed in FeGaB/PIN-PMN-PT heterostructures. This strong magnetoelectric coupling combined with excellent electric and temperature stability makes FeGaB/PIN-PMN-PT heterostructures potential candidates for high-power tunable radio frequency/microwave magnetic device applications.},
