 abstract = {Multiferroic heterostrcture composed of ferromagnetic and ferroelectric phase has recently attracted ever-increasing amount of interest due to its strong magnetoelectric coupling at room temperature [1-3]. In particular, the strain-mediated magnetoelectric (ME) coupling arising from the combined piezoelectric and magnetoelastic effect has shown a large modification of the magnetic anisotropy of the ferromagnetic layer by the application of electric field. This enables various applications including low power spintronics, voltage tunable microwave devices, magnetic sensors and etc [4, 5].},
