 abstract = {Antiferroelectric (AFE) materials with adjacent dipoles oriented in antiparallel directions have a double polarization hysteresis loops. An electric field (E-field)-induced AFE-ferroelectric (FE) phase transition takes place in such materials, leading to a large lattice strain and energy change. The high dielectric constant and the distinct phase transition in AFE materials provide great opportunities for the realization of energy storage devices like super-capacitors and energy conversion devices such as AFE MEMS applications. Lots of work has been done in this field since 60-70 s. Recently, the strain tuning of the spin, charge and orbital orderings and their interactions in complex oxides and multiferroic heterostructures have received great attention. In these systems, a single control parameter of lattice strain is used to control lattice-spin, lattice-phonon, and lattice-charge interactions and tailor properties or create a transition between distinct magnetic/electronic phases. Due to the large strain/stress arising from the phase transition, AFE materials are great candidates for integrating with ferromagnetic (FM) materials to realize in situ manipulation of magnetism and lattice-ordered parameters by voltage. In this paper, we introduce the AFE material and it's applications shortly and then review the recent progress in AFEs based on multiferroic heterostructures. These new multiferroic materials could pave a new way towards next generation light, compact, fast and energy efficient voltage tunable RF/microwave, spintronic and memory devices promising approaches to in situ manipulation of lattice-coupled order parameters is to grow epitaxial oxide films on FE/ferroelastic substrates.},
