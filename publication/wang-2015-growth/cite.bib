 abstract = {In our experiment, the influence of growth parameters of the spin-spray technique upon the microstructure and magnetic/microwave properties of NiZn spinel ferrite thin film was studied. By varying the pH value of precursor and oxidizer, the microstructure of NiZn ferrite thin film can be manipulated, further, bringing varying magnetic/microwave properties. High permeability $μ$r′ \textgreater 200 at 0.5 GHz with low loss tan$δ$m ̃0.027 at 3–5 GHz range was achieved at precursor pH value of 4.6 and oxidizer pH value of 9.6. These magnetic/microwave properties are ideal for GHz range microwave application, for example, inductors, antennas, and electromagnetic interference suppression.},
