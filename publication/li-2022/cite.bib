 abstract = {We report measurements of magnon spin transport in a spinel ferrite, magnesium aluminum ferrite \$\backslashmathrm\MgAl_\0.5\Fe_\1.5\O_4\\$ (MAFO), which has a substantial in-plane four-fold magnetic anisotropy. We observe spin diffusion lengths \$\textgreater 0.8\$ \$\backslashmathrm\\backslashmu m\\$ at room temperature in 6 nm films, with spin diffusion length 30% longer along the easy axes compared to the hard axes. The sign of this difference is opposite to the effects just of anisotropy in the magnetic energy for a uniform magnetic state. We suggest instead that accounting for anisotropy in exchange stiffness is necessary to explain these results.},
