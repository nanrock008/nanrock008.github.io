 abstract = {We report low-temperature spin spray deposited Fe3O 4/ZnO thin film microwave magnetic/piezoelectric magnetoelectric heterostructures. A voltage induced effective ferromagnetic resonance field of 14 Oe was realized in Fe3O4/ZnO magnetoelectric (ME) heterostructures. Compared with most thin film magnetoelectric heterostructures prepared by high temperature (\textgreater600 C) deposition methods, for example, pulsed laser deposition, molecular beam epitaxy, or sputtering, Fe3O 4/ZnO ME heterostructures have much lower deposition temperature (\textless100 C) at a much lower cost and less energy dissipation, which can be readily integrated in different integrated circuits.
