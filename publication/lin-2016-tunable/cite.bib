 abstract = {We present the miniaturized RF tunable band-pass filter based on magnetoelectric NEMS coupled ring-shaped FBAR resonator with contour mode of transmission. The acoustic wave can be strongly coupled with the radiation electromagnetic wave due to the strong magnetoelectric effect between the piezomagnetic FeGaB and piezoelectric AlN thin film. For the FBAR resonator, a return loss of -11.15 dB and insertion loss of 3.57 dB with high quality factor of 252 can be achieved at 93.165MHz. The band-pass filter performs sensitive magnetic field dependence with âˆ¼0.5% magnetic field tunability of the operation frequency.},
