Energy-efficient and deterministic switching of magnetization can be achieved when spin polarizations of these spin currents are collinear with the magnetization.

There are clearly big opportunities for miniaturized antennas. However, the antenna miniaturization has been an open challenge for centuries, until recently. We have created small antennas that have size 100 times smaller than the state-of-the-art antennas through the innovation in their radiation and transmission mechanisms. We proposed a new acoustically actuated antenna concept: the use of acoustic waves to drive the oscillation of magnetic moment which radiates electromagnetic waves. We constructed and integrated our antennas by the combination of microelectromechanical system (MEMS) and the magnetoelectric thin film materials onto silicon wafers. Such game-changing antennas no longer resonate with electromagnetic waves but radiate electromagnetic waves by the actuation of acoustic waves. Because acoustic waves have much smaller wavelength (as the acoustic wave velocity is much smaller than that of the light wave), we created an acoustic antenna, which operates at 2.5 GHz, miniaturizes the current antenna size over two orders of magnitudes.

Importantly, the spin-orbit interaction induced spin polarized currents can interact with magnetic moment and exert torque on the adjacent magnetic materials. Such torque, also known as spin-orbit torque, can efficiently switch the magnetization, and provide means of controlling topological solitons in chiral spin textures (i.e. skyrmions). Materials with high-efficient intrinsic spin-charge conversion is the key to enable those interesting applications.\nStrongly correlated materials, which harbor quantum many-body system, can be a fertile playground for both fundamental understanding of spin-orbit effects, since the interplay between electron correlation and spin-orbit interaction can give rise to non-trivial electronic band topologies and nonzero Berry curvature. However, such materials have not been fully exploited in the fundamental studies or applications of spintronics so far. We have shown that a perovskite correlated semimetal SrIrO3 can indeed generate pure spin current via the spin-Hall effect at room temperature more efficiently than that reported for elemental heavy metals.

The coexistence and coupling of these two sublattices create a landscape for discovery and manipulation of quantum phenomena such as the topological Hall effect, massless conduction bands, and quantum criticality. Thin films allow extended control of the material system via symmetry-lowering effects such as strain. While bulk Pr2Ir2O7 shows a spontaneous hysteretic Hall effect below 1.5 K, we observe the effect at elevated temperatures up to 15 K in epitaxial thin films on (111) yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) substrates synthesized via solid-phase epitaxy. Similar to the bulk, the lack of observable long-range magnetic order in the thin films points to a topological origin. We use synchrotron-based element-specific x-ray diffraction and x-ray magnetic circular dichroism to compare powders and thin films to attribute the spontaneous Hall effect in the films to localization of the Ir moments. We link the thin-film Ir local moments to lattice distortions absent in the bulklike powders. We conclude that the elevated-Temperature spontaneous Hall effect is caused by the topological effect originating either from the Ir or Pr sublattice, with interaction strength enhanced by the Ir local moments.

However, its experimental realization has remained elusive. Here, the coexistence of the strain-mediated ME coupling and the SOT in a CoFeB/Pt/ferroelectric hybrid structure is shown experimentally. The voltage-induced strain only slightly modifies the efficiency of SOT generation, but it gives rise to an effective magnetic anisotropy and rotates the magnetic easy axis which eliminates the incubation delay in current-induced magnetization switching. The phase field simulations show that the electric-field-induced effective magnetic anisotropy field can reduce the switching time approximately by a factor of three for SOT in-plane magnetization switching. It is anticipated that such strain-mediated ME-SOT hybrid structures may enable field-free, ultrafast magnetization switching.","tags":["magnetoelectric effect","phase-field simulation","spin Hall effect","spin–orbit torque"],"title":"A Strain-Mediated Magnetoelectric-Spin-Torque Hybrid Structure","type":"publication"},{"authors":["T.

Conventional heavy metals have been extensively explored due to their strong SOC of conduction electrons. However, spin-orbit effects in classes of materials such as epitaxial 5d-electron transition-metal complex oxides, which also host strong SOC, remain largely unreported. In addition to strong SOC, these complex oxides can also provide the additional tuning knob of epitaxy to control the electronic structure and the engineering of spin-to-charge conversion by crystalline symmetry. Here, we demonstrate room-temperature generation of spin-orbit torque on a ferromagnet with extremely high efficiency via the spin-Hall effect in epitaxial metastable perovskite SrIrO3. We first predict a large intrinsic spin-Hall conductivity in orthorhombic bulk SrIrO3 arising from the Berry curvature in the electronic band structure. By manipulating the intricate interplay between SOC and crystalline symmetry, we control the spin-Hall torque ratio by engineering the tilt of the corner-sharing oxygen octahedra in perovskite SrIrO3 through epitaxial strain. This allows the presence of an anisotropic spin-Hall effect due to a characteristic structural anisotropy in SrIrO3 with orthorhombic symmetry. Our experimental findings demonstrate the heteroepitaxial symmetry design approach to engineer spin-orbit effects. We therefore anticipate that these epitaxial 5d transition-metal oxide thin films can be an ideal building block for low-power spintronics.","tags":["Epitaxial thin films","Spin-Hall effect","Spin-orbit torque","SrIrO3"],"title":"Anisotropic spin-orbit torque generation in epitaxial SrIrO3 by symmetry design","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhiguang Wang","Cunzheng Dong","Xinjun Wang","Menghui Li","Tianxiang Nan","Xianfeng Liang","Huaihao Chen","Yuyi Wei","Haomiao Zhou","Mohsen Zaeimbashi","Syd Cash","Nian-Xiang Sun"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"d66ad2dd0b7eb88d428475f88891309f","permalink":"https://nanrock008.github.io/publication/wang-2018-highly/","publishdate":"2020-07-26T10:11:26.331097Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wang-2018-highly/","section":"publication","summary":"Flexible tactile sensor has been extensively investigated as a key component for emerging electronics applications such as robotics, wearable devices, computer hardware, and security systems.

Here, we introduce highly sensitive integrated flexible tactile sensors based on uniform phase-change Ge2Sb2Te5 (GST) thin films that can scale device size down, at least, to micrometer range.

In addition to the well-known tunable electrical and optical properties, the piezoresistive GST films provide a versatile platform for the integration of sensing, recording, and displaying functions. By reducing feature size to one micron, flexible tactile sensors with high spatial resolution and sensitivity are demonstrated. A collaborative team led by Nian-Xiang Sun from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Northeastern University developed integrated flexible tactile sensors and sensor arrays with high sensitivity and spatial resolution. The sensor's high sensitivity (e.g. gauge factor of 338) is due to developed piezoresistive Ge2Sb2Te5 thin films. To obtain a high spatial resolution above 12,700 pixels per inch, the sensor's feature size was reduced to one micron.

The high dielectric constant and the distinct phase transition in AFE materials provide great opportunities for the realization of energy storage devices like super-capacitors and energy conversion devices such as AFE MEMS applications. Lots of work has been done in this field since 60-70 s. Recently, the strain tuning of the spin, charge and orbital orderings and their interactions in complex oxides and multiferroic heterostructures have received great attention. In these systems, a single control parameter of lattice strain is used to control lattice-spin, lattice-phonon, and lattice-charge interactions and tailor properties or create a transition between distinct magnetic/electronic phases. Due to the large strain/stress arising from the phase transition, AFE materials are great candidates for integrating with ferromagnetic (FM) materials to realize in situ manipulation of magnetism and lattice-ordered parameters by voltage. In this paper, we introduce the AFE material and it's applications shortly and then review the recent progress in AFEs based on multiferroic heterostructures.

However, the coupling mechanism and precise qualification of the exchange coupling in CoFe/BiFeO3 heterostructures have been elusive. Here we show direct evidence for electric field control of the magnetic state in exchange coupled CoFe/BiFeO3 through electric field-dependent ferromagnetic resonance spectroscopy and nanoscale spatially resolved magnetic imaging. Scanning electron microscopy with polarization analysis images reveal the coupling of the magnetization in the CoFe layer to the canted moment in the BiFeO3 layer. Electric field-dependent ferromagnetic resonance measurements quantify the exchange coupling strength and reveal that the CoFe magnetization is directly and reversibly modulated by the applied electric field through a ∼180° switching of the canted moment in BiFeO3. This constitutes an important step towards robust repeatable and non-volatile voltage-induced 180° magnetization switching in thin-film multiferroic heterostructures and tunable RF/microwave devices.","tags":null,"title":"Probing electric field control of magnetism using ferromagnetic resonance","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tianxiang Nan","Ziyao Zhou","Ming Liu","Xi Yang","Yuan Gao","Badih A.

We demonstrated in this work, the quantification of the coexistence of strain and surface charge mediated magnetoelectric coupling on ultra-thin Ni0.79Fe0.21/PMN-PT interface by using a Ni0.79Fe0.21/Cu/PMN-PT heterostructure with only strain-mediated magnetoelectric coupling as a control. The NiFe/PMN-PT heterostructure exhibited a high voltage induced effective magnetic field change of 375 Oe enhanced by the surface charge at the PMN-PT interface. Without the enhancement of the charge-mediated magnetoelectric effect by inserting a Cu layer at the PMN-PT interface, the electric field modification of effective magnetic field was 202 Oe. By distinguishing the magnetoelectric coupling mechanisms, a pure surface charge modification of magnetism shows a strong correlation to polarization of PMN-PT. A non-volatile effective magnetic field change of 104 Oe was observed at zero electric field originates from the different remnant polarization state of PMN-PT.

Varying the concentration of the solution brought about a dramatic change in the crystal growth behavior and crystalline orientation, with the least concentration producing rods more uniform and oriented in the c-axis direction. The optical absorption dependence of the ZnO microstructures was also studied by ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer.

This was realized through strain-mediated magnetoelectric coupling between ferroelectric PZT and ferromagnetic FeGaB layer. Two reversible and stable voltage-impulse induced mechanical strain states were obtained in the PZT by applying an electric field impulse with its amplitude smaller than the electric coercive field, which led to reversible voltage impulse induced bistable magnetization switching. These voltage impulse induced bistable magnetization switching in multiferroic heterostructures provides a promising approach to power efficient bistable magnetization switching that is crucial for information storage. © 2012 American Institute of Physics.","tags":null,"title":"Voltage impulse induced bistable magnetization switching in multiferroic heterostructures","type":"publication"}]
